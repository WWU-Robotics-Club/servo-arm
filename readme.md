Servo robot arm inspired by [Pinaut's project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLnAJ-mSElE)

pot_control controls the arm via a second arm with potentiometers to measure position like in Pinaut's video.

For assembly instructions see the readme under [instructions](instructions/readme.md).

blueberry_servo_arm is made to work with "keyframes" function of [this fork](https://github.com/CalebJ2/Android-Bluetooth-Remote-Control) of the blueberry remote control app. With the app, keyframe animations can be saved on the phone and played back on the arm.
