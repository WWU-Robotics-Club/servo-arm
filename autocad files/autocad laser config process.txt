Some notes on using autocad with an epilog laser cutter.

If lines aren't a polyline:
- select line on shape
pedit
- select rest of shape
join

General setup:
- select shape to offset because laser doesn't account for cut width
offset in 0.1, out 0.2
- make new cuts layer under layer properties, select color
- select offsets, go to properties, move layer
- output->plot (or page setup manager the first time)
- set output to engr-epilog-pc3
- plot style epilog.ctb
- drawing orientation portrait
- pick square paper size, eg. 48x48"
- change plot area window, set to same size as paper
- change scaling to appropriate units
- printer is 12 wide, 18 tall
- printer properties for print settings
